                “To the skeptics, perhaps the events that are to follow were just a coincidence and nothing more than a
                series of random accidents that led me to where I am today. But to the lovers and poets and dreamers,
                perhaps you might agree that the story about to unfold is something more. You might even agree that
                there are times when coincidences are so powerful that they don’t really seem like coincidences anymore.
                Times when you come across events that seem too strange, or too strong, to be anything other than Fate—a
                grand design that incorporates everything from the career paths we take, the friends we meet along the
                way, and the partners we choose to spend our lives with. Times like these make you question that maybe
                nothing in this world happens by accident. Maybe everything really does happen for a reason, as some
                prewritten destiny slowly takes shape and shoves you down a path—or in my case, a mountain side.”
